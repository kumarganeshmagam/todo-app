# AI Integration Guide

This todo app now includes AI-powered features similar to Apple Notes and Samsung Galaxy Notes. The AI functionality is modular and designed to work seamlessly with your existing workflow.

## üöÄ Features

### 1. **Notes & Blog AI Features**
- **Summarize Selected Text**: Select any text in your notes or blog posts and use AI to create concise summaries
- **Rewrite & Format**: Improve grammar, clarity, and structure of selected content
- **Replace Content**: AI suggestions can replace your selected text directly

### 2. **Tasks AI Features**
- **Speech-to-Task**: Click the microphone button and speak to add tasks naturally
- **Extract Tasks**: Select any text (from notes, emails, etc.) and extract actionable tasks automatically
- **Smart Task Creation**: AI processes speech input to create clear, actionable task items

## üîß Setup & Configuration

### Ollama Configuration (Primary AI Provider)
1. Install Ollama on your system
2. Pull the llama2 model: `ollama pull llama2:latest`
3. Ensure Ollama is running on `http://localhost:11434`

### Future Extensions
The system is designed to support multiple AI providers:
- **OpenAI** (hooks implemented, not activated)
- **Claude** (hooks implemented, not activated)

## üí° How to Use

### In Notes/Blogs:
1. Select text you want to improve
2. Use the AI toolbar that appears
3. Choose "Summarize" or "Rewrite"
4. AI will replace your selected text

### In Tasks:
1. **Speech Input**: Click the microphone and speak your task
2. **Text Extraction**: Select text from anywhere and click "Extract Tasks"
3. **Multiple Tasks**: AI can extract multiple tasks from a single text selection

## üõ°Ô∏è Fallback Handling

If AI is unavailable:
- All features gracefully show: "This functionality is not available right now"
- Your app continues to work normally without AI
- No data loss or functionality interruption

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Modular Design
- `lib/ai.ts`: Core AI provider system
- `components/ai-toolbar.tsx`: Reusable AI interface
- `components/speech-to-task.tsx`: Voice input component
- `hooks/use-text-selection.ts`: Text selection management

### Provider System
- Easy to switch between AI providers
- Consistent interface across all providers
- Built-in error handling and fallbacks

## üéØ Integration Philosophy

‚úÖ **What We Did:**
- Added AI features without changing existing functionality
- Kept the original app structure intact
- Made AI features optional and non-intrusive
- Implemented proper fallback handling

‚ùå **What We Avoided:**
- Breaking existing features
- Forcing users to use AI
- Complex configuration requirements
- Dependency on external services

## üîç Testing the Integration

1. **Test Notes AI**: Create a note, select text, try summarize/rewrite
2. **Test Blog AI**: Write a blog post, select content, use AI features
3. **Test Speech-to-Task**: Click microphone in Tasks, speak a task
4. **Test Task Extraction**: Select text anywhere, extract tasks

## üö® Troubleshooting

**AI features not working?**
- Check if Ollama is running: `ollama list`
- Verify model is available: `ollama pull llama2:latest`
- Check browser console for connection errors

**Speech recognition not working?**
- Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Edge)
- Grant microphone permissions when prompted
- Check if HTTPS is enabled (required for speech API)

## üéâ Success!

Your todo app now has powerful AI integration that enhances productivity without disrupting your existing workflow. The AI features work seamlessly alongside your current tasks, notes, and blog management.
